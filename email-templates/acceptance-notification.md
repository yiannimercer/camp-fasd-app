Dear CAMP Family,

Your camper has been accepted to participate in CAMP's Summer Camp Program. We are both excited and looking forward to seeing you this summer!

You can download the parent's information packet here:

[2025 Parent Info Packet](https://app.fasdcamp.org/wp-content/uploads/2025-Parent-Info-Packet.pdf)

Please take some time to carefully look through this and discuss pertinent information with your camper before arriving at camp.

The following consists of information and deadlines that parents and families should be immediately aware of.

## CAMP Application
You will be receiving an email from our website that states you were enrolled in camp and will include additional application materials and questions. These questions must be answered no later than August 1st. The system will automatically send emails if there are questions that are incomplete. If you believe your application is complete but are still receiving emails, please contact admin@fasdcamp.org.

## Camp Tuition
Parents and families are responsible for paying the $1095 fee no later than August 1st. If the balance is not paid by this date, the camper's spot is not guaranteed and will be open to other campers on the waitlist. If you are interested in applying for a camp scholarship, please visit www.fasdcamp.org/camp-scholarships for more information.

## Medication Update
The **Medical Details** section in the application allows you to input your campers prescription medications. **We ask that parents and families review and if necessary update their camper's medication after August 1st.** To ensure a quick and efficient check-in process, it is critical that the medications that are listed in the application accurately reflect the medications that are brought to camp.

## Emergency Contacts
In the case of an emergency, CAMP requests that parents/families have an individual that can get to camp within 24 hours' notice. If this person is not a parent or guardian, they must be listed as an emergency contact. Please contact admin@fasdcamp.org if this cannot be made possible.

Sincerely,

**CAMP — A FASD Community’s Camp Directors**

Dear CAMP Family,

Thank you so much for starting your application to be part of our annual summer camp program. Applications are reviewed on a rolling basis, and decisions will be made based on the number of staff available.  Decisions on your application cannot be made until an adequate amount of information on the application has been provided. Therefore, we ask families to complete their applications in a timely manner. Decision notifications typically begin to be communicated mid-to-late March, however it can be weeks or months after this before a family receives notification. We appreciate your patience as we work to establish our staff, thank you!

**Please make special note of the following while completing your application:**

New camp families should budget 1-2 hours to complete the entire application, and returning camp families should budget 30-45 minutes to complete the application.
You can save your progress and move on to another section, but you must complete all  questions before the application is considered submitted (your progress should hit 100%). Any sections that still need answers will **not** show a green checkmark icon next to the section title in the sidebar, making it easier to know where to finish up.

We understand some sections take longer than others, therefore we recommend completing as much as you can, and only leaving sections that you are waiting on external parties (e.g., Doctor's Signature) for a later time.
Applications may be initially reviewed when they are near completion, but official acceptance can not be granted until the app is 100% complete.

Finally, questions regarding the application process, status, or decision to withdraw your application can be sent directly to admin@fasdcamp.org.

Thank you,

Hi {{firstName}},

⏳

## Waitlist Update

Thank you for your patience. **{{camperName}}'s** application for CAMP {{campYear}} has been placed on our waitlist.

---

> **This does not mean {{camperName}} won't attend camp**—it simply means we need more time before we can confirm acceptance.

---

Due to current staffing capacity, we're temporarily delaying acceptances until we can bring on additional team members to ensure every camper receives the support they need.

### What this means:

- Your application is complete and has been reviewed
- We don't have a timeline for when we'll have an update
- There is a possibility that we may not be able to accommodate all waitlisted applicants

---

We know waiting is hard, and we appreciate your understanding. We'll reach out as soon as we have an update.

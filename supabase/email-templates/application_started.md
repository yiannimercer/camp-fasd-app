Dear CAMP Family,

🏕️

## Thank You for Starting Your Application!

Thank you so much for starting your application to be part of our annual summer camp program. We're excited you're interested in joining our community!

### 📋 What to Expect

Applications are reviewed on a **rolling basis**, and decisions are made based on staff availability. Decisions on your application cannot be made until adequate information has been provided, so we ask families to complete their applications in a timely manner.

**Decision notifications** typically begin mid-to-late March, however it may be weeks or months after this before a family receives notification. We appreciate your patience as we work to establish our staff!

### ⏰ Time Estimates

| **Returning families** | 30-45 minutes |

### 💡 Tips for Completing Your Application

- **Save as you go** — You can save your progress and return later. Your progress saves automatically!
- **Track your progress** — Sections without a green checkmark still need answers
- **100% required** — Your application isn't considered submitted until progress hits 100%
- **Don't wait on others** — Complete what you can now, and leave sections requiring external parties (e.g., Doctor's Signature) for later
- **Near-complete review** — Applications may be initially reviewed when near completion, but official acceptance requires 100% completion

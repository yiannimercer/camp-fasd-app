#### 💊 Medication Update

The **Medical Details** section allows you to input your camper's prescription medications. **We ask that you review and update medication information after August 1st.** To ensure a quick and efficient check-in process, it is critical that the medications listed in the application accurately reflect the medications brought to camp.

#### 📞 Emergency Contacts

In case of an emergency, CAMP requests that you have an individual who can get to camp within 24 hours' notice. If this person is not a parent or guardian, they must be listed as an emergency contact.

Contact [admin@fasdcamp.org](mailto:admin@fasdcamp.org) if this cannot be made possible.
